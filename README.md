# ClassAllot

ClassAllot is a software which simplifies the process of allocating classrooms to courses at Ashoka (or any other) university. Just input the list of courses along with faculty preferences, the list of classrooms and the list of available time slots and let the program do its magic. Sit back and relax while the program allocates all the courses to free classrooms, or tells you about the inconsistencies for which allocation isn't possible. Professors will love it!
